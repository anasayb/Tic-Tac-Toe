# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is A Tic-Tac-Toe game that was developed by python.

There are two programs in this project, both of them are Tic-Tac-Toe games but they are developed using different AI approaches.

The sources of the original codes and logic of the program are mentioned as a comment in the first line of each file, but both files contained a personly modified version of the original codes.  

I hope you find it interesting and fun.
